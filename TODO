Try 3D for map generation.  More dimensions makes a better layout.

Either project 3D to 2D map, or make an interactive 3D map.

[project to 2D]
--> Find orientation that minimses total overlap and project.
--> Generate on a sphere and then fold sphere out.

[interactive 3D]
--> Generate on a sphere and view sphere.  Makes it much simpler to control
    view location and zoom level, since there is no orientation to deal with.
--> When zoomed in, can send vector data and render 3D in the canvas with full
    orientation control.  But then need to have a sky box background which must
    be precomputed for each position.
--> For a discrete number of orientations (N,S,E,W,etc) can project view to a
    small number of planes and shift their orientation and size to simulate pan
    and zoom.
